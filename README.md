# Simple single page site

I have used the Sveltekit for the first time to create something, I started out by using the basic skeleton option to
play around with making a site for a business.
The client very simply wanted a single image in the center as a landing page and also a contact form, and i thought this
was a good opertunity to try out svelteKit and github hosting, so here goes!

[//]: # (I have a whole mix of clients who either are new to the website world or they have an old coal fired option we are going to overhaul. It will be nice to play with modern javascript based frameworks instead of staying on Wordpress for such simple setups.  )

## Technical-ish stuff

The framework is SvelteKit locally developed in Webstorm, built using vite.
Github is doing the hosting through the pages feature and I have my domains DNS settings pointing here.

### Todo

- Initial Branch (Main)
    * ~~Create basic site locally~~
    * ~~Host site on github pages~~
    * ~~Swap DNS records of site to point directly to github hosting~~
- New Branch (Form)
    * Create form and link with EmailJS, keep static vibe but with functionality.
    * Sort HTTPS/SSL with Github setup
